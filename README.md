# Code Quiz
Columbia Module 4 Challenge: Web APIs

## User Story

AS A coding boot camp student,
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores,
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers.

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz,
WHEN I click the start button,
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question.
WHEN I answer a question,
THEN I am presented with another question.
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly,
THEN time is subtracted from the clock.
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0,
THEN the game is over.
WHEN the game is over,
THEN I can save my initials and my score.

## Description

In this Challege, I implement what I have learned in class about Web APIs in order to create a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. Given that it is likely I will be asked in the future to complete a coding assessment - perhaps as part of an interview process - it is important to become familiar with these tests. I have utilized JavaScript and Web APIs to create the interactive features of the quiz, including the questions and answers, the timer, and the high scores. I have utilized HTML and CSS to create a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. I have based my multiple-choice questions on JavaScript information I have learned in the boot camp.

## Visuals (Need to Complete)

Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation (Need to Complete)

Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection. Include what software programs were used to complete the web application.

## Usage (Need to Complete)

Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README. Provide instructions and examples for use.
